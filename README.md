# Quiz Application (In Progress)

This project is a **Quiz Application** built as part of my Web3Bridge frontend learning assignment.  
The goal of the assignment is to build a quiz app using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with at least **50 questions**.

At the time of submission, the project is **partially completed** and will be improved further after submission.


## Features Implemented So Far

- Start Quiz button on the home screen
- Rules displayed before starting the quiz
- Ability to continue to the quiz or exit back to the home screen
- Quiz interface with:
  - Question display
  - Multiple choice options
  - Next Question button
- Question counter in the footer (e.g. `1 of 50`)
- 50 quiz questions added (JavaScript, HTML & CSS basics)
- Result box displayed after the last question
- Interactive **Replay Quiz** button:
  - Restarts the quiz from the first question after completing the quiz
  - Resets question progress and counter
- Interactive **Quit Quiz** button:
  - Returns the user to the start quiz home screen
  - Resets quiz state for a fresh attempt


## How the App Works

1. The app starts with a **Start Quiz** button.
2. Clicking **Start Quiz** opens an information box showing the quiz rules.
3. Clicking **Continue**:
   - Hides the info box
   - Displays the quiz box
   - Loads the first question
4. Clicking **Exit Quiz** returns the user to the start screen.
5. Each question displays four options.
6. Clicking **Next Question** loads the next question.
7. The footer updates to show the current question number.
8. When the last question is reached and **Next** is clicked, the **Result Box** is displayed.
9. When **Result Box** is displayed the user will choose to **Replay the Quiz** or **Quit the Quiz**
10. Clicking **Replay Quiz** restarts the quiz from Question 1.
11. Clicking **Quit Quiz** returns the user to the start screen.
